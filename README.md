# Heyo! 👋  
## About Me

I'm **David Burguillos**, a Web Design student at NAIT, diving deep into the world of design and digital creativity.

### 🎨 Design Philosophy
Designing is more than just code—it's about capturing a vibe, a story. I’m especially passionate about **typography** and **color** as they bring any design to life, making each project feel unique and meaningful.

### 🌐 Beyond the Screen
When I'm not crafting websites, you can find me:
- 📸 Exploring ubran streets outside Edmonton, capturing the perfect shot in the stillness beyond city life.
- ☕ Sipping on a delicious dirty chai at one of my favorite local cafes.

Let’s connect and create something amazing together!
