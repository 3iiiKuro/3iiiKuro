# Heyo! 👋  
## About Me

I'm **David Burguillos**, a Web Design student at NAIT, diving deep into the world of design and digital creativity.

### 🎨 Design Philosophy
Design to me is making noise. Making things stand out and pop out. Whether it comes to fashion or design, I want to make a statement about who I am. I stay consitent to show that it's just me.

### 🌐 Beyond the Screen
When I'm not melting down, trying to learn new things, you can find me:
- Modding and retexturing games like Cyberpunk 2077 and Monster Hunter World
- You can also catch me taking pictures of all my favourite cars around Edmonton. @3iiiKuro on Instagram

Let me know if I can help you with anything. I'm always here.
